The completed project will:

Monitor the water levels in a reservoir and print an alert when the level is too low
Monitor and display the current air temp and humidity on an LCD screen
Start and stop a fan motor as needed when the temperature falls out of a specified range (high or low)
Allow a user to use a control to adjust the angle of an output vent from the system
Allow a user to enable or disable the system using an on/off button
Record the time and date every time the motor is turned on or off. This information should be transmitted to a host computer (over USB)
